# guessing_game

This was my second assignment during my first week at the Iron Yard. It is a console based number guessing game.

Our assignment was to first write a script that would choose a random number and then ask the user to 
take guesses on what it might be. The game will give clues as to whether 
the user is close and tell if the guess is too high or low.

The hard mode assignment of the game was to reverse the game play and have 
the computer take guesses at a secret number guessed by the user.
